Parents learn about the school key players and their children


This Management Information System supports parents to communicate and be self-involved efficiently and effectively in school issues
so as to bring about meaningful management of parent involvement at the selected school, as well as top-level management to involve
themselves with parents thus creating a highly competitive school of the country.

Records of all students, parents to the students, teachers of the school are kept in the system.
This enbles parents monitor student behaviour, performance, and contact the teachers via phone call or email to discuss about their children.

The system therefore promotes maximum awareness of the parents about school activities to boost the performance of students mentally, socially
academically and spiritually, et cetera.
